## Purpose

QR Watchface lets you create a QR code for any URL or text and display it on your Apple Watch face. This makes it easy to share links, contact info, event details, or anything else scannable: right from your wrist. Why do we need an app for that? If you want to not only show your QR code but also the time, we need to employ some sorcery ðŸª„ - this is what this app does: Adding some margin around the QR code so that it fits your watch.

## Key Features

## Architecture

The project is built with React and is fully modularized for maintainability and scalability. Each logical section of the UI is a separate component.

### Component Structure

- `App.js` :  Main entry point, handles routing and global state (e.g., dark mode)
- `QRCodeGenerator.js`: Home page, manages QR code state and composition
  - `HomeHeader.js`: Page title
  - `HomeImage.js`: Apple Watch hero image
  - `HomeDescription.js`: Feature description
  - `HomeForm.js`: Input, QR code rendering, and download button
  - `HomeFooter.js`:  Footer with author info
- `InstructionsPage.js`: Instructions for setting the QR as a watchface
  - `InstructionsHeader.js`: Instructions page title
  - `InstructionsSection.js`: Step-by-step guide and links
  - `StepList.js`: List of steps for the user
- `QRCodeGenerator.css`:  All styling, including dark mode and responsive design

### Routing

- `/` :  Home (QR code generator)
- `/instructions` :  Step-by-step Apple Watch setup guide

### QR Code Generation

- Uses [`qrcode.react`](https://github.com/zpao/qrcode.react) for fast, reliable QR rendering
- Downloaded images are padded and scaled for optimal watchface appearance
